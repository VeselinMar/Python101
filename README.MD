# Python101

A collection of extended simple Python projects and practice exercises demonstrating foundational Python skills.

This repository contains small Python programs I built while learning Python and reinforcing core programming concepts such as control flow, functions, loops, and basic algorithms. Each project focuses on a different topic and illustrates practical usage of Python syntax and problem-solving.

## What’s in This Repository

These projects cover beginner and early-intermediate Python topics, including:

- Basic Python syntax and operators
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)
- Functions and modular code
- Simple games and utilities
- Algorithmic problem solving

Each directory or script typically contains:

- Python source code (`*.py`)
- A README or comment block explaining the problem
- Example input/output


## Project List

Here are some of the included fun and educational scripts:
```
| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `find_root_of_quadratic_e` | Solves quadratic equations using the quadratic formula. Accepts coefficients as input and calculates real or complex roots. |
| `quiz_game` | A simple interactive quiz game where users answer multiple-choice questions and receive a score at the end. |
```

## How to Run

To run any of the included scripts:

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VeselinMar/Python101.git
cd Python101
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. Run a script using Python:
```bash
python game.py
```
## Learning Goals
- Writing Python scripts from scratch
- Using functions to organize code
- Handling user input and validation
- Implementing control flow logic (if/else, loops)
- Debugging and iterating on solutions
